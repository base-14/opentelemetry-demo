> **Note: This is a Base14 fork of the official OpenTelemetry Demo**
>
> This fork extends the original [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) with additional features, including a comprehensive Helm chart and Scout observability platform integration.
>
> **Added Features:**
> - **Production-ready Helm Chart** with full Kubernetes deployment support
> - **Scout Integration** - Alternative to built-in telemetry stack (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana)
> - **Enhanced Documentation** with deployment guides and troubleshooting

## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo

This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based
distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world environment.

**This Base14 fork enhances the original demo with:**
- **Kubernetes-native deployment** via comprehensive Helm chart
- **Scout observability integration** for centralized telemetry
- **Production-ready configurations** for enterprise deployment

Our goals are threefold:

- Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to
  demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.
- Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and
  demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.
- Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new
  versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.

We've already made [huge
progress](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md),
and development is ongoing. We hope to represent the full feature set of
OpenTelemetry across its languages in the future.

If you'd like to help (**which we would love**), check out our [contributing
guidance](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you'd like to extend this demo or maintain a fork of it, read our
[fork guidance](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/forking/).

## Quick start

You can be up and running with the demo in a few minutes. This Base14 fork provides multiple deployment options:

### Deployment Options

#### Helm Chart (Recommended - Base14 Addition)
Deploy with our production-ready Helm chart:

```bash
# Standard deployment
helm install otel-demo ./helm-chart/otel-demo -n otel-demo --create-namespace

# With Scout integration
helm install otel-demo ./helm-chart/otel-demo -n otel-demo --create-namespace -f helm-chart/otel-demo/values-scout.yaml
```

**Features:**
- Complete Kubernetes deployment with all services
- Built-in telemetry stack (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana) or Scout integration
- Production-ready configurations with resource limits and health checks
- Comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guides

**[Complete Helm Chart Documentation](./helm-chart/otel-demo/README.md)**

#### Original Deployment Methods
- [Docker](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/docker_deployment/)
- [Kubernetes (Original)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/kubernetes_deployment/)

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, see [Demo Documentation][docs]. If you're curious
about a specific feature, the [docs landing page][docs] can point you in the
right direction.

## Base14 Enhancements

### Scout Integration

This fork includes native integration with **Scout**, Base14's comprehensive observability platform. Scout provides:

- **Unified Observability**: Traces, metrics, and logs in a single platform
- **Advanced Analytics**: AI-powered insights and anomaly detection
- **Enterprise Features**: Multi-tenancy, RBAC, and compliance controls
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent sampling and data retention policies

#### Getting Started with Scout

1. **Get Scout Credentials**: Contact Base14 for your Scout endpoint and API key
2. **Deploy with Scout**: Use the provided `values-scout.yaml` configuration
3. **Access Dashboard**: View your telemetry data in the Scout platform

```bash
# Configure Scout values
cp helm-chart/otel-demo/values-scout.yaml my-scout-config.yaml
# Edit my-scout-config.yaml with your Scout credentials

# Deploy with Scout
helm install otel-demo ./helm-chart/otel-demo -n otel-demo --create-namespace -f my-scout-config.yaml
```

For more details, see the [Helm Chart Scout Integration Guide](./helm-chart/otel-demo/README.md#scout-integration).

### Production-Ready Helm Chart

Our Helm chart provides enterprise-grade deployment capabilities:

- **Scalable Architecture**: StatefulSets for stateful services, Deployments for stateless
- **Resource Management**: Configured limits and requests for all services
- **Health Monitoring**: Liveness and readiness probes
- **Security**: RBAC, service accounts, and network policies
- **Flexibility**: Enable/disable individual services as needed
